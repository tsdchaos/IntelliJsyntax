Inheritance:
is a mechanism in which one class aquires all the properties and behaviors/methods of the parent class
Except private members  (fields/methods) and constructors
Benefits:
1) Saves time to code
2) uses less memory
3) Execution time is less
4) code duplication is reduced
Disadvantages:
1) In inheritance base class and child class, both are tightly coupled. Hence if you change the code of the parent
class, it will affect all the chiled classes.

Types of Inheritance:
There are four major types of inheritance which are supported in most OOP languages, but java only supports 3 types with
class
1) single, hierarchical, multilevel, multiple (not supported by classes in java
A) Single Inheritance: If we only have one parent and one child class, it is called single inheritance
    EXAMPLE:
    public class Parent{}
    public class Child extends Parent{}

B) Hierarchical Inheritance: If we only have one parent, but multiple children classes, it is called Hierarchical
Inheritance
    EXAMPLE:
    public class Parent{}
    public class Child1 extends Parent{}
    public class Child2 extends Parent{}
    public class Child3 extends Parent{}

C)Multilevel:  a class extends from another class that is already extended from another class
    EXAMPLE:
    public class GrandParent{}
    public class Parent extends GrandParent{}
    public class Child extends Parent{}
D) Multiple (not supported by java classes): One child, multiple parents
    EXAMPLE:
    public class Parent1{}
    public class Parent2{}
    public class Child extends Parent1, Parent2{}

DIAMOND PROBLEM:
    public class Parent1{
    void print name(){}
    }
    public class Parent2{}
    public class Child extends Parent1, Parent2{}
