Maps:
Maps are data structures that can store the data in the form of key value pairs

There are three famous types of maps in Java:
1) HashMap
    - Insertion order is not preserved
    - Good for when we need good performance and we don't care about the order of the data
2) LinkedHashMap
    - Insertion order is maintained
    - Slower in performance than a hashmap when it is comes to retrieving the data
    - Better insertion speed than treeMaps
3) TreeMap
    - Store the data in sorted form
    - Insertion is slow. Retrieval is fast
    - Insertion is slow because TreeMap has to compare the data with existing elements

================================
To read the data from a file, we must have the following:
    1) Path(Location) of that file on our computer
    2) Appropriate program must be installed on the computer to read the data from that file
        - For example: For .xlsx, we must use Microsoft Excel or a similar program
        - For .pdf files, we can use Adobe Reader
        - For .txt we can use Notepad
    3) We must also know a little bit about the structre of that file. For example, in excel files, data is stored in the
    form of workbooks. Inside workbooks, we have sheets. Inside sheets, we have rows, and columns, or cells

Why we should learn about File Handling in Java:
- We store sensitive data in files instead of code so that no one can access that data
- We write the code inside Java programs to read that info at run time from some kind of file
perform the test, and once testing is done we delete those files
- When we have to test web forms, we don't put all the testing data inside the code. We create files, for the data to read
the data from thoise files and test those web forms
