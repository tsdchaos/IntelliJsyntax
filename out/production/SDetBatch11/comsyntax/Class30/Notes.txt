Why learning fileHandling in Java:

1) Putting sensitive info inside the code is not a good idea because everyone who has access to the code
will be able to see them

2) Every time we test our applications on different environments, we have to change the code to update the credentials.
It's also not a good idea and can introduce bugs

We will be discussing two types of files
1) .properties file
    - Data is stored in the form of key value pairs
    - To read the data from any file
        - We should know the path we can use FileINputStream class to load that file inside java program
    - FileInputStream loads the data inside the program in the form of bytes
    - Properties.load() method data is converted to key value pairs and we can use the methods from Map interface to
    read and write the data
2) Excel File
