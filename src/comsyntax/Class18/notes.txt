Constructors:
a special block of code that helps us build/construct (giving initial values to the fields) the object
When we write new ClassName(), this executes the constructor
When we do not write a constructor, then the compiler will automatically create a default constructor
If there are multiple constructors in a class, then java will check for the number, type, and sequence of the parameters

Rules:
1.Constructors have same name as the class name
2. Dont have return types, not even "void"
3. We can use the "this" keyword with parentheses to invoke the other constructors of the same class
4. We can use the "this" keyword to differentiate local and instance variables.
