Super keyword:
super is the keyword that we use to refer to the parent class instance
we can use super keyword in 3 different ways
1) to call the parent class constructor
2) to call the methods from parent class
3) to use the fields from the parent class

class Parent{
String name="Jeff";
double salary;
Parent(){

}
void eat(){
System.out.println("Burschetta");
}
}
class Child extends Parent{
String "Alan";
void eat(){
System.out.println("Pizza");
}
printFood(){
System.out.println(super.name); //takes the name from the parent class
System.out.println(name); //takes the name from the child class
super.eat(); //takes the eat method from the parent class
eat(); //takes the eat method from the child class
}
}
When using the Super keyword, the super keyword must be called before anything else
