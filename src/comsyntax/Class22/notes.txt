Rules for Casting objects/classes
1) We can store a child class object inside a parent type variable because inheritance is one way from parent to child.
2) We can create arrays of type Parent and can store all the child classes inside that array then we can write
loops to call all the methods from all the classes
3) We cannot store/cast a Parent class object to the Child class. But if parent type variable

Final Keyword:
If we write final with a variable we can not change its valuer. Either we should initialize it right away, or through the constructor.
It is best practice to type all final variables or classes in all caps
When used with method, we can't override that method in a child class
When used with class, you cant extend that class from another class
