"final" is a keyword in java that we can use with classes fields and methods. It is a non-access modifier.
1) Final classes cannot be inherited (they cannot be modified further in children classes) to prevent overuse of inheritance
2) When used with methods, that method cannot be overriden in child classes
3) When used with fields, we cannot change the value of that field
