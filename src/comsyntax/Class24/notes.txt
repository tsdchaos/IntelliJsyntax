Abstraction is a process that hides implementation details and showing only functionality to the user
Abstract classes:
1) Abstract classes in java are classes with the abstract keyword.
2) We use abstract classes when we are sure about the method header, but not sure about the implementation.
3) We can declare a class as abstract class without having any abstract methods inside it
4) Once we have at least one abstract method, we must declare that class as abstract.
5) We can have non-abstract methods as well inside the abstract class.
6) We need a child class to provide implementation of the abstract methods
7) The child class can provide the implementation of all the methods or it can leave some methods unimplemented
8) We can't have a class or method "final" and "abstract" at the same time.
9) We can't use abstract keyword with fields and constructors
10) Abstract methods dont have body in the parent class.
11) Abstract is a non access modifier.
