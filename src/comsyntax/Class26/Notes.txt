Wrapper Classes:
    Wrapper classes are object classes around primitive datatypes that have built in methods,
    and are used as objects where necessary. For example, in collections framework
    Wrapper classes provides us a mechanism to use primitive data types as objects

Boxing
    The automatic conversion of primitive data types into its equivalent Wrapper, is called Boxing
    For example,
    Integer i=new Integer(10); //boxing

AutoBoxing
    The automatic converseion of primitive data types into its equivalent Wrapper is called autoboxing
    Integer i=10;

Unboxing:
    The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types is called Unboxing
    Integer i=new Integer(10);
    int i2=i.valueOf();

AutoUnboxing:
    The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types is called Unboxing
    Integer i=10; //autoboxing
    int i2=i; //auto unboxing

Collection Framework
    Collection provides architecture to store and manipulate the group of
    objects that are represented as a single unit
    We have many interfaces and classes inside the framework to achieve this.
    ArrayList
    <> diamond operator is used to specify the data type in collections framework.
    ArrayList<Double> numbers=new ArrayList<>();
